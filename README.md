NDB Cluster integrates the standard MySQL server with an in-memory clustered storage engine called NDB (which stands for “Network DataBase”). In our documentation, the term NDB refers to the part of the setup that is specific to the storage engine, whereas “MySQL NDB Cluster” refers to the combination of one or more MySQL servers with the NDB storage engine.
